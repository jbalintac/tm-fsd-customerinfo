# Customer Info

## Overview
A very simple customer listing app.

Hypothetically this should be listing B2B customers, however the current initial data represent my work experiences employers and the companies of my job applications (you can say from my point of view ─ my customers).

## Improvement Recommendations
- Add "Add customer" functionality (This wasn't on the requirement)
- Create Api and Web unit tests.
- Further refactor on Api and Web SRP.
- Font responsiveness.


## Prerequisite
Build & Run:
- Docker, Docker Compose

Development:
- Node, NPM
- Python 3.7


## Build
Run `docker-compose up -d` to build and run the project. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 


## Development
For local, none docker-compose development run in order:
- `docker-compose up -d customerinfo-db`
- Allow some time for customerinfo-db to finish initializing before issuing the next step
- On `./api/` run only once `python manage.py db upgrade` to scaffold the database
- On `./api/` run `python manage.py run`
- On `./web/` run  `ng serve -c local`

If using docker-compose:
- `docker-compose up -d`
- On subsequent changes just run on the changed service: `docker-compose up -d --no-deps --build <service_name>`


## Deployment
- Change `./web/src/environments/environment.prod.ts` to correct deployed api path
- Change `docker-compose.yml` `customerinfo-web.ports` to correct deployment port


## Troubleshoot
- For error such as  `Error starting userland proxy: mkdir /port/tcp:0.0.0.0:`  try restarting you local docker
- Make sure port 4200, 5000 are unused.
- Make sure all containers are running and healthy when navigating to `http://localhost:4200/`
- Allow some time for `customerinfo-db` to finish initializing in some instance.
- Each service is dependent on one other and it would be necessary to run the component in order: Db, Api, Web. This is already configured on the `docker-compose.yml` thus by running the `docker-compose up -d` should be enough.
- Check on `docker ps -a` if containers up and healthy.
